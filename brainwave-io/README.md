# Umbrl Frontend Development Task

For this project, I utilized the Figma screen design provided for desktop, dividing each section into components within the "section" folder (`src/app/section`) to be displayed on the index page (`page.js`).

In the layout document, I modified the global fonts using Urbanist as a close match to the Gilroy font using lighter weight fonts and tracking changes. This was a suitable alternative as it is included in the `next/font` library.
